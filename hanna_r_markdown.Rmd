## EDA
Institution size (number of students) for campuses with more than 15,000 students versus campuses with 15,000 or fewer students for liquor law violations.

```{r EDA}
institution_size <- ifelse(cleaned_data$Institution.Size_all_campus > 15000, "Large", "Small")

ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = institution_size, y = all_liquor_violations)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Institution Size With Mean Liquor Law Violations",
       x = "Institution Size",
       y = "Mean Liquor Violations") +
  theme_minimal()
